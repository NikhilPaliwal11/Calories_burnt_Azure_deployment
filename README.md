## 🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction

Developed an end-to-end Machine Learning project using Python to predict the number of calories burnt during a workout based on biological and workout-related parameters.

The project follows modular coding practices and covers the complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion to cloud deployment.

### 🔹 Project Details

- Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using modular coding
- Implemented stages:
  - Data Ingestion  
  - Data Transformation  
  - Model Training  
  - Prediction Pipeline  

- Trained and compared the following models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  

- Logged model performance for easy comparison
- Applied One-Hot Encoding and Standard Scaler
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Selected best hyperparameters to train the final model
- Predicts calories burnt based on:
  - Age, Height, Weight  
  - Workout Duration  
  - Heart Rate  
  - Body Temperature
